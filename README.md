## Summary
This project will be focusing on the COVID-19 impacts in the US economy regarding the unemployeement rate and poverty. 
I'll further look into the counties in which job losses are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

## Introduction
We all know that COVID-19 has severly impacted the World's economic this year. Many people lost their jobs and companies freezed their hiring. This makes new grad even
harder to proceed their job seeking process.

The challenge of this project is to integrate the unemployement data of each county with COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CVI). The CVI is a measurement that helps us
to understand how COVID-19 has negatively impacted the US economy in regards to the employement upon a region's mix of industries.

Some questions:

- Which county has a higher Labour Force?
- Which county has a higher unemployment rate?
- Which county has a higher COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CVI)?
- What is the correlation between the CVI and the Unemployment rate?
- Which county has higher CVI among the top county with a higher unemployment rate?
- What are the changes in Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) images of that area?
